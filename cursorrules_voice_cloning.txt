# Voice Cloning Project - Barkoni Voice Clone
# Mission: Clone Barkoni's voice for LLM text-to-speech synthesis

## CORE MISSION - NEVER DEVIATE
- Primary Goal: Create accurate voice clone of Barkoni's Hebrew speaking patterns
- Target Voice: Barkoni (Israeli Hebrew YouTuber/content creator)
- Output: Functional voice synthesis model that captures Barkoni's vocal characteristics

## PROJECT SCOPE RESTRICTIONS
- ONLY work on voice cloning, audio processing, and TTS model training
- DO NOT suggest alternative voices or generic Hebrew voices
- DO NOT change the target voice without explicit request
- STAY FOCUSED on Barkoni specifically - no generic solutions

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Use modern voice cloning frameworks (RVC, SoVITS, Tortoise-TTS, or Bark)
- Implement Hebrew language support and phoneme recognition
- Handle Hebrew text preprocessing and normalization
- Support real-time or near-real-time voice synthesis
- Maintain audio quality suitable for content creation

## HEBREW LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS
- Modern Hebrew (Israeli accent) is the target
- Handle Hebrew text-to-phoneme conversion correctly
- Consider Hebrew grammatical gender in voice synthesis
- Account for Hebrew-specific pronunciation patterns (guttural 'r', etc.)
- Support mixed Hebrew-English content if needed

## CODE STANDARDS
- Write clean, modular Python code for audio processing
- Use established ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Include proper error handling for audio file processing
- Document all voice processing parameters
- Create reproducible training pipelines

## AUDIO DATA REQUIREMENTS
- Focus on collecting clean Barkoni voice samples
- Implement audio preprocessing (noise reduction, normalization)
- Handle various audio formats and quality levels
- Create training/validation data splits
- Maintain dataset organization and metadata

## RESPONSE FORMAT
- Provide working code examples
- Include setup instructions for dependencies
- Show example usage with Hebrew text
- Explain voice cloning parameters and their effects
- Keep explanations technical but accessible

## WHAT NOT TO DO
- Don't suggest changing the target voice
- Don't recommend generic Hebrew TTS solutions
- Don't overcomplicate the architecture without cause
- Don't ignore Hebrew language requirements
- Don't suggest alternatives unless current approach fails

## PROGRESS TRACKING
- Focus on incremental improvements to voice quality
- Test with sample Hebrew phrases from Barkoni's content
- Measure similarity to original voice
- Document model performance and limitations
