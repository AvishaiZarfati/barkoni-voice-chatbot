## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### 1. Realistic Voice System (`realistic_barkuni_voice.py`)

### 2. Test System (`test_realistic_chatbot.py`)

- Character-appropriate expressions
- Male voice optimized for Barkuni

from realistic_barkuni_voice import RealisticBarkuniVoice
voice = RealisticBarkuniVoice()
voice.speak_as_barkuni("Shalom! Ma nishma?")
```
